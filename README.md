# Automated-Cloud-Infrastructure-Deployment-using-Terraform-Ansible & AWS

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a fully automated, repeatable system for provisioning and configuring cloud infrastructure on AWS 
using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools‚Äî**Terraform** for deployment and **Ansible** for post-provisioning setup.

## üì¶ Project Overview

**Terraform**  - Used to define and provision AWS resources like VPC, subnets, security groups, and EC2 instances 

**Ansible**  - Handles remote configuration of the provisioned EC2 instance, including Docker installation and container setup 

**AWS**  -  Serves as the cloud platform where infrastructure is hosted 

**Docker**  -  Runs containerized services such as NGINX, backend APIs, monitoring stacks 

*(Later Phase)* **Amazon Bedrock**  - A generative AI layer for log summarization 


## üìÅ Tech Stack

- **Terraform**
- **Ansible**
- **AWS (EC2, VPC, IAM)**
- **Docker**
- **Linux/Ubuntu**
- **Amazon Bedrock**
